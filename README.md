Implement (in C++) a PCA algorithm [Lever et al., 2017], [Smith, 2002], to find the covariance matrix and <em>two</em> (2) principal components of this data-set. Results should answer the following questions:

<ol>

 <li>What are the Eigenvalues for the principal components 1 and 2?</li>

 <li>What are the Eigenvectors for the principal components 1 and 2 (showingJuly and January component values for each)?</li>

 <li>Compute the values for the covariance matrix.</li>

 <li>What is the total variance?</li>

 <li>What proportion (as a percentage) of total variance do principal components 1 and 2 ”explain”?</li>

</ol>
